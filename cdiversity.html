                            <p class="mbr-editable-content"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer question posed above, the origins of courtship behaviour must be considered.
Niko Tinbergen’s four questions of animal behaviour are useful in determining the lineages of
the behaviour (Tinbergen, 1963). Figure 1 outlines the differences between Tinbergen’s four
questions. In Tinbergen’s studies, he found that the study of animal behaviours can be based on 2
levels, proximate and ultimate (Tinbergen, 1963). For the purpose of looking at the origins of
courtship behaviour, we will be focusing on the ultimate mechanisms that sculpt behaviour:
phylogeny, and adaptive value.</p><p></p>

                            <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phylogeny is based on the evolution of a species. A phylogeny is a term used to describe a group of species that are related to each other through evolutionary time (Tinbergen, 1963). Scientists use phylogeny to hypothesis relatedness between species that possess similar traits, and the possibilities of how they may have evolved from a common ancestor (Tinbergen, 1963). That being said, it is possible that evolution may be a reason why courtship and reproductive behaviours may be so diverse. Over time, single species have evolved in different directions to create different species, which may has caused variation of similar courtship behaviours, and the formation of new ones, from a common ancestor. An example of this can be found in the Tit family of birds.</p><p></p>

                            <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family of tit birds is incredibly diverse; however, their courtship generally involves the use of intricate chirps as mating calls. While the courtship behaviour similar between all tits, there is diversity in the bird songs between species, and individuals within a species (Doutrelant, 2003). A study by Doutrelant et al. demonstrates that within the Blue tit species, males who have a greater amount of songs are more attractive to females (2003). This illustrates that through time, females are driving evolution by choosing individuals with more complex songs. As populations get fragmented new species begin to evolve, their songs change to become increasingly more complex (Laiolo, 2008). The assortment of songs within these taxa of birds is a process of evolution, and how the species may be similar in courtship styles, still exhibit a diversity in their calls</p><p></p>

                    <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adaptive value of a trait or behaviour is also referred to as the survival value, adaptive significance, or function. It is overall the idea that traits and behaviours change and have adapted based on their value to an individual in a specific condition. The value of a trait is dependent on the environment that the organism is exposed to. Changing environments causes behaviour to adapt based on their value.<br>
<br>               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be hypothesised that a reason why courtship displays are so diverse is because of the different environments that they evolved in. Species that live in arctic conditions will have different reproductive behaviours than species from more tropical environments. Species related by an ancient common ancestor that have evolved under different environmental conditions are likely to have changed their reproductive behaviours based on which behaviours are more beneficial. </p><p></p>

When animals are faced with any kind of situation, their behaviour can determine whether the result of the situation will resolve beneficially, costly, or have an equal cost and benefit. To explain this further, consider the following: a hungry tiger is placed in a cage with an unfamiliar hungry tiger, the middle of the cage contains a pile of food. The result of this thought experiment can go one of four ways: (1) both tigers fight for food, neither of them benefit, (2) Tiger one fights tiger two, tiger one wins and receives all the food, (3) Tiger two fights tiger one, tiger two wins leaving none for tiger two, (4) both tigers share the food. This is an example of how game theory might work; the actions of each individual determine their outcome of costs or benefits.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p>

                            <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relating back to courtship rituals and reproductive behaviours, in most cases the benefit of reproduction is far greater than the cost, as the goal in animal copulation is reproduction. Game theory is more related to the evolution of the courtship behaviours, as well as the type of reproductive relationships of a species. Similar to the adaptive value concept, game theory illustrates that individuals will choose behaviours that are most beneficial depending on the circumstances. This is a demonstration that over time reproductive behaviours that are the most beneficial to an individual will be passed along to future generations, and be learned by other individuals, while other behaviours that are less useful will be left behind. This creates diversity of these behaviours between species and individuals within a species. </p><p></p>
