                            <p class="mbr-editable-content"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer question posed above, the origins of the behaviour must be considered. To do this, Niko Tinbergen’s four questions of animal behaviour are useful in determining the lineages of the behaviour (Tinbergen, 1963). Figure 1 outlines the differences between Tinbergen’s four questions. In Tinbergen’s studies, he found that the study of animal behaviours can be based on 2 levels, proximate and ultimate (Tinbergen, 1963). For the purpose of looking at the origins of courtship behaviour, we will be focusing on the ultimate mechanisms that sculpt behaviour: phylogeny, and adaptive value.</p><p></p>

                            <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phylogeny is based on the evolution of a species. A phylogeny is a term used to describe a group of species that are related to each other through evolutionary time (Tinbergen, 1963). Scientists use phylogeny to hypothesis the relatedness between species that possess similar traits, and the possibilities of how they may have evolved from a common ancestor (Tinbergen, 1963). It is possible that a reason why courtship and reproductive behaviours are so diverse is due to evolution. Over time, species have evolved in different directions, which may has caused variation of courtship behaviours from a common ancestor. An example of this can be found in the Tit family of birds.</p><p></p>

                            <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family of tit birds is incredibly diverse, however their courtship generally involves the use of intricate chirps as mating calls. While the courtship behaviour similar between all tits, there is diversity in the songs between species, and individuals within a species (Doutrelant, 2003). A study by Doutrelant et al. demonstrates that within the Blue tit species, males who have a greater amount of songs are more attractive to females (2003). This illustrates that through time, females are driving evolution by choosing individuals with more complex songs. As populations get fragmented new species begin to evolve, and their songs will change to become increasingly more complex (Laiolo, 2008). The assortment of songs within this taxa of birds is a process of evolution, and how the species may be similar in courtship styles, but differ greatly in their vocalizations as a result of populations changing over time.</p><p></p>

                    <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adaptive value of a trait or behaviour is also referred to as the survival value, adaptive significance, as well as function. It is overall the idea that traits and behaviours have changed and been adapted based on their value to the individual of a species. The value of a trait is dependent on the environment that the organism is exposed to. Changing environments is the cause behaviour adapting based on their value.
<br>
<br>               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be hypothesised that a reason why courtship displays are so diverse because of the different environments that they have been adapted too. For example, the way polar bears by participate in reproductive behaviours is different than a black bear. These two species, while genetically related, have adapted to different environments, and their behaviours are more valuable in the location that they inhabit.</p><p></p>

                            <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game theory is a statistical model created by John von Neumann, that was investigated later by biologists to study behaviour. When animals are faced with any kind of situation, their behaviour can determine weather the result of the situation will resolve beneficially, costly, or have an equal cost and benefit. To explain this further, consider the following: a hungry tiger is placed in a cage with an unfamiliar hungry tiger, the middle of the cage contains a pile of food. The result of this thought experiment can go one of four ways: (1) both tigers fight for food, neither of them benefit, (2) Tiger one fights tiger two, tiger one wins and receives all the food, (3) Tiger two fights tiger one, tiger two wins leaving none for tiger two, (4) both tigers share the food. This is an example of how game theory might work; the actions of each individual determine their outcome of costs or benefits.</p><p></p>

                            <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relating back to courtship rituals and reproductive behaviours, in most cases the benefit of reproduction is far greater than the cost, as the goal in animal copulation is reproduction. Game theory is more related to the type of reproductive relationship that an individual participates in. Courtship styles between organism may be so diverse due to the cost and benefits related to the relationship. For example, the courtship styles of species that are primarily monogamous, will be different from those who are polyamorous. Species with individuals who reproduce polyamorous will have different courtship styles than species. The sexual systems of a species influence the cost and benefit of different courtship behaviours, and increases the diversity of courtship behaviours.</p><p></p>
